  <h5>AngularJs 1 Vs AngularJs 2 & Features of AngularJs 2</h5>
  <p>
    Here we will see the comparison between Angular 1 and Angular 2 as well as i will explain the features that are introduced in AngularJs 2.
  </p>
  <p>
  <ion-icon name="beer"></ion-icon> It is written entirely in Typescript and meets the ES6 specification. And it’s not an update for Angular 1.x. As it’s rewritten and includes breaking changes.<br /> <br />
<ion-icon name="beer"></ion-icon> As per ng-conf meetup,
Angular 2 is 5 times faster as compared to Angular 1 <br /><br />
<ion-icon name="beer"></ion-icon> Angular 2 is mobile oriented & better in performance, It uses Hierarchical Dependency Injection system which is major performance booster.<br /><br />
<ion-icon name="beer"></ion-icon> More languages Support: You can use any of the languages from ES5, ES6, TypeScript, Javacript or Dart to write Angular 2 code.<br /><br />
<ion-icon name="beer"></ion-icon> AngularJS 2.0 is not easy to setup as AngularJS 1.x: In angular 1 you just have to include one library now Angular 2 is dependent of other libraries and it requires some efforts to set up it. <br /><br />
<ion-icon name="beer"></ion-icon> Different case for built-in directives. for example: ng-class is ngClass, and ng-Model is ngModel now. <ion-icon name="happy"></ion-icon> <br /><br />
<ion-icon name="beer"></ion-icon> No Controllers & Scope now: Angular 2 uses Components <br /><br />
<ion-icon name="beer"></ion-icon> Components: Angular 2 uses web standards like component instead of controllers, it provides better performance than Anuglar 1. <br /> <br />
<ion-icon name="beer"></ion-icon> Angular 2 Html DOM element properties and events: One of the major change in Angular 2 is, that it directly uses the valid HTML DOM element properties and events. Due to this, many of the available built-in directives in Angular 1.x are now no longer required. Like ng-href, ng-src, ng-show and ng-hide. Angular 2 uses href, src and hiddenproperties to get the same output. And same goes with event based directives like ng-click and ng-blur. ng-click="myFun()" is now (click)="myFun()".
 <br /> <br />
  If you have read the previous section "What is AngularJs 2" carefully you can understand what power AngularJs2 comes with, Angular 2 is not just an update of Anulgar 1, it is rewritten, dont worry in the coming section we will start learning Angular 2 from very basics, if you are new to Angular world, you are at right place. Let's move on.
